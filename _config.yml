  I'm a second year masters student in Statistics (Data Science specialisation)
  interested in how Applied ML and Statistics can be used for social good.
  <br><br>
  Prior to Stanford I worked in Wall Street as a trader for 9 years, leaving
  because I wanted a more technical challenge.
  <br><br>
  I've lived in London, New York and the Bay Area, and am an avid traveller
  having visited over 50 countries. In my free time I love socialising, music,
  and sport, and am currently training for my first marathon.
